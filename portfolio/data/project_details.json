    "overview": "A dynamic, data-driven portfolio designed to distinguish a fresher from the crowd. Unlike static templates, this site uses a JSON-based content architecture to serve as a centralized CMS for my projects.",
    "problem": "Most student portfolios are static HTML files that are hard to maintain and lack interactivity. I needed a platform that demonstrated my ability to handle data, manage state, and build polished UIs without relying on heavy frameworks like React.",
    "solution": "I architected a Flask (Python) application that separates data from presentation. The frontend uses Jinja2 templating with a glassmorphism design system, while the backend handles routing and SMTP email dispatching.",
    "features": [
      "JSON-driven content management (No database required)",
      "Dark/Light mode with local storage persistence",

    "overview": "FamilyConnect is a private social networking prototype built to simulate the core architecture of platforms like Facebook, but optimized for close-knit family groups.",
    "problem": "Public social networks sell user data and lack privacy. Families needed a secure, isolated platform to share memories without algorithmic interference.",
    "solution": "I developed a monolithic Flask application with a normalized MySQL schema. The system uses session-based authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and server-side image processing to ensure speed and security.",

    "problem": "Student group projects often fail due to fragmented communication across WhatsApp, Email, and Drive. We needed a single 'Source of Truth'.",
    "solution": "I built a role-aware system (Admin vs Member) using Flask. The app features a Kanban-style task tracker, a central document repository, and real-time status updates.",

    "problem": "I wanted to understand the math behind game states and how computers 'think' in zero-sum games, rather than just building a simple CLI tool.",

    "problem": "Critical information about exams, schedules, and seminars was often missed because it was only posted on a physical wooden board.",
    "solution": "I developed a multi-page responsive website with a custom CMS. Faculty can log in to upload PDF notices, while students get a mobile-friendly news feed.",
