    "overview": "A high-performance, data-driven portfolio website designed to serve as a centralized content management system for my personal brand. Unlike typical static site generators, this application uses a custom JSON-based architecture to decouple data from the presentation layer, allowing for instant content updates without recompiling code. It serves as a living document of my skills, featuring a highly interactive UI that adapts to user preferences and device constraints.",
    "problem": "Static HTML portfolios are difficult to maintain; updating a single project often requires editing multiple HTML files, leading to code duplication and errors. Conversely, full-blown CMS solutions like WordPress are too heavy and bloated for a simple developer showcase. I needed a lightweight, custom solution that demonstrated full-stack capability while remaining performant, accessible, and easy to update via a simple data file.",
    "solution": "I built a Flask (Python) application that renders Jinja2 templates dynamically based on local JSON data stores. The frontend implements a sophisticated glassmorphism design system using raw CSS variables for easy theming. The architecture separates concerns strictly: data lives in JSON, logic in Python, and presentation in HTML/CSS. This allows me to add a new project by simply appending an object to a text file, without touching a single line of frontend code.",

    "overview": "FamilyConnect is a private social networking prototype designed to simulate the core architecture of platforms like Facebook, but optimized for close-knit family groups. It focuses on privacy, data sovereignty, and secure media sharing without the algorithmic noise of public networks. The platform allows family units to create private spaces where they can share milestones, photos, and updates without fear of data mining.",
    "problem": "Public social networks monetize user data and expose family memories to the public internet. Furthermore, their algorithms prioritize engagement over connection, often hiding important family updates. There was a clear need for a self-hostable, isolated environment where families could own their data and share updates securely.",
    "solution": "I developed a monolithic Flask application backed by a normalized MySQL database. The system implements strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and uses server-side session management to ensure that only authenticated family members can access content.

It solves the problem of fragmented communication by providing a single dashboard for tracking deadlines, sharing resources, and managing project milestones. Think of it as a simplified Trello or Asana, tailored for the specific needs of student groups.",
    "problem": "Student group projects often fail due to miscommunication across multiple channels like WhatsApp, Email, and Google Drive. Teams lacked a 'Single Source of Truth' for their project status, leading to missed deadlines and duplicated work.",
    "solution": "I built a lightweight project management tool using Flask and Bootstrap. It features a Kanban-style workflow (To Do, Doing, Done) and a centralized file repository system.

It goes beyond simple if-else logic to implement a reactive opponent.",
    "problem": "Building a Command Line Interface (CLI) game is simple, but rendering a responsive GUI and programming an opponent that actually 'blocks' user moves requires understanding game loops, coordinate geometry, and state evaluation.",
    "solution": "I wrote a custom rendering loop using Python Turtle to draw the board and pieces. The core technical highlight is the AI logic, which evaluates the board state after every turn. It identifies winning threats across all 8 axes (rows, columns, diagonals) and prioritizes blocking the player over making a random move.",
